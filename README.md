# React-Redux Test

### This is a repo with tests regarding React-Redux and other libraries

This taks consist of building a simple app using React framework and libraries, such as: 

  - Redux
  - Redux-Saga
  - Styled Components
  - Recompose
  - Reselect
  - etc...

  The app is already set up with CRA.

  ### The task as follows:
  
  It is necessary to create a user interface to render fake users from this endpoint: [JSON user Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)

  It should look like this: 
  [React user list](https://i1.wp.com/www.andreasreiterer.at/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/react-contact-manager-ui-concept.jpg?w=590&ssl=1)

  Rules:

  - Use only styled-components for styling (no className props ðŸ˜‰)
  - Use React-Saga for handling effects
  - Use Redux (of course duh!)
  - Redux modules should follow [redux ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) structure 
  - Use [Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) for avoiding using useless class elements

  *extra: Try to use [flow](https://flow.org/) for types!*

  ### Good luck!
